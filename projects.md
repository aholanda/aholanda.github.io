# Source Code

I write some programs and libraries and most of them are stored in:

- [Educational Github](https://github.com/prof-holanda?tab=repositories);
- [Personal Github](https://github.com/ajholanda?tab=repositories);
- [Professional Github](https://github.com/aholanda?tab=repositories);


- University of SÃ£o Paulo's [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.uspdigital.usp.br/aholanda).

# Web pages

Some projects have a web page generated from source code or 
built to publish additional material not inserted into the
manuscript:

- [CharNet](/charnet/)
- [pandiso](/pandiso/)
